# Verilog Practice Projects 🚀

Welcome to my Verilog practice projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Verilog projects that I've worked on for learning and practice purposes.

## Project List 📋

1. **[Project 1: hex2seg](./hex2seg)**
   - A simple 4 bit haxadecimal to sevent segment decoder
   - Assumes a common anode on the Nexys A7-100t FPGA
2. **[Project 2: Latches and flipflops](./latches_and_dffs)**
   - An RTL description of latches and flipflops.
   - The difference between them is shown in the test
